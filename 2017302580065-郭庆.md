## 2 Problems

p7

At first, we need get the ip address of the target.

T~getAddress~ = RTT~1~+RTT~2~+...+RTT~n~

And then we need communicate with the target and get the resource back.

T~link-and-download~ = 2*RTT~0~

In total, the time from when we click the hyper link to when we receive the object is

T = T~getAddress~+T~link-and-download~ = 2*RTT~0~+RTT~1~+RTT~2~+...+RTT~n~



p14

SMTP

uses a line containing only one periond to mark the end of message body.

HTTP

uses "Content-Length header field" to indicate the length of message.  The length can indicate the end of message body.

No, cuz HTTP message could be binary data, whereas in SMTP, the message body must be in 7-bit ASCâ…¡ format.



p28

a)Cuz the TCP Server doesn't exist, the TCP connection between client and server will never be made.(They need make the connecion first, after that, the message can be sent and received.)

b)

Cuz the message between UDP-Server and UDP-Client can be transformed without former connection.

So, everything will be fine if u run the UDP-Client first, and input your message.

c)

If u use different port number in Client and Server.

from b), we can infer that no error will happen in UDP-Client, whereas the UDP-Server can't receive the message cuz the different port numbers.

In TCP-Connection, at first, the client want to establish a connections  between Client and Server, but the different port number let the Connection will nerver be made successfully. Thus, a connection error will happen.
