a)

​	If there is $\frac{us}{N}<d_{min}$，then the maximium transmission rate between server to each client is $\frac{us}{N}$.  And the transmission processes are simultaneous, so the whole time taken is the same as the time one client needs to recieve the complete file, which is  $\frac{F}{us/N}=\frac{NF}{us}$.

b)

​	Conversely, if there is  $\frac{us}{N}>d_{min}$, then the maximum transmission rate is $d_{min}$. Also the transmission processes are simultaneous, so we get the distribution time  $\frac{F}{d_{min}}$.

c) 

​	We have already known that minimum distribution time is $T\geq max\{\frac{NF}{u_s},\frac{F}{d_{min}}\}$；

​	If $\frac{us}{N}<d_{min}$, then we get  $T\geq \frac{NF}{u_s}$, but from a) we have  $T\leq \frac{NF}{u_s}$, thus gives us
$$
T = \frac{NF}{u_s}
$$
​	Similarly, if $\frac{us}{N}>d_{min}$, then we have 
$$
T=\frac{F}{d_{min}}
$$
​	So the minimum distribution time is generally given by $max\{\frac{NF}{u_s},\frac{F}{d_{min}}\}$.

Let $u = \sum u_i,i=1,2,...,N$;

Firstly, the server divides the file into N parts, with the $i^{th}$ part having size of  $\frac{ui}{u}F$;

Then, the server transmits the $i^{th}$ part to the $i^{th}$ peer at rate $\frac{ui}{u}u_s$ beacause $d_{min}$ is very large;

Simultaneously, peer $i$ recieves other parts of file from other peers, and for each of the peer-to-peer $(j->i)$ route, we have $u_j > \frac{uj}{u}u_s$ because $u_s <\frac{u}{N}$, thus the transmit rate between peer $j$ and peer $i$ is $\frac{uj}{u}u_s$;

So that means, $j^{th}$ file part of size $\frac{uj}{u}F$ is transmitted from server to peer $i$ via peer $j$ at rate $\frac{uj}{u}u_s$;

Considering the transmission of each file part is simultaneously, then we have the ultimate distribution time $\frac{uj}{u}F/$$\frac{uj}{u}u_s=\frac{F}{u_s}$.

b)

Now that $u_s>u/N$, so transmission rate between peer $j$ and peer $i$ is $u_j$ for $u_j<\frac{uj}{u}u_s$;

Consider a route $server->peer\,j->peer\,i$, the minimum transmission rate on it decides the overall transmission rate.

And we have known that: 

1. From server to peer $j$, the transmission rate is $\frac{uj}{u}u_s$;

2. From peer $j$ to peer $i$, the transmission rate is $uj$;  
3. $u_j<\frac{uj}{u}u_s$;

Thus a file part of size $\frac{uj}{u}F$ is transmitted to peer $i$ at rate $u_j$;

Considering the transmission of each file part is simultaneously, then we have the ultimate distribution time $\frac{uj}{u}F/$$u_j=\frac{F}{u_1+u_2+...+u_N}$.
