2.task2 :  I choose P14 P15 P29

P14:

SMTP uses a line containing only a period to mark the end of a message body. 

HTTP uses “Content-Length header field” to indicate the length of a message body.  

No, HTTP cannot use the method used by SMTP, since HTTP message could be binary data. However,in SMTP, the message body must be in 7-bit ASCII format. 



P15:

The MTA represents the mail transport agent. The host sends the message to the MTA. The message then follows a series of mtas to reach the recipient's mail reader. You can find that this spam follows an MTA chain. The honest MTA should report where it received the message. Please note that in this message, "asusus-4b96([58.88.21.177])" does not report the location of the E-mail it received. Since we assume that only the originator is dishonest, "asusus-4b96([58.88.21.177])" must be the originator. 



P29:

It's not necessary to change UDPServer.py , reasons are as followed:

In the original program, the UDPClient did not specify the port number socket when the port was created.In this case, the code allows the underlying operating system to select the port number.Using the additional line, the UDP socket number 5432 is created using the port when the UDPClient is executed.

UDPServer needs to know the client port number so that it can send packets back to the correct client socket.Looking at UDPServer, we see that the client port number is not "hardwired" into the server code;Instead, UDPServer determines the client port number by unlocking the datagram received from the client.Therefore, the UDP server will be compatible with any client port number, including 5432.

Before the modification:

Client socket =X (selected by OS)

Server socket =9876

In the following cases:

Client socket =5432
