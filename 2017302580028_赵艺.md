**Problem 13**

"MAIL FROM:" in SMTP is sent to the SMTP server to identify the source address of the email. It's a part of the SMTP protocol.

While "From:" is a part of the message content. 

**Problem 28**

a) If we run TCPClient before we run TCPServer, the TCPClient will try to connect to a nonexistent server, and the connection will fail.

b) If we run UDPClient before we run UDPServer, the UDPClient will run successfully and the data transmition won't be affected. Because there is no handshaking between the UDPClient and UDPServer before sending data.

c) If we use different port numbers for client and server sides, the connection between client and server will fail.

**Problem 29**

It's not necessary to change UDPServer.py because the UDPServer will get the port number from the datagram that UDPClient sent to it.

After the modification, the port number for socket in UDPClient is 5432.

Before the change, the port number for socket in UDPClient is decided by the operating system.

And the port number for socket in UDPServer is the number binded in UDPServer.py
