### 3 Problems

**P21.**

We can use command `dig server`, and replace the 'server' with the host we want to test. If the query time returned is extremely short, we can tell that someone has sent request message to the host seconds ago. 

**P23.**

a. Server sends files to each client in parallel with the same upload speed us/N. For that us/N ≤ d_min, so each client will download the file in the same speed FN/us, and the distribution time will be NF/us. 

b. Assume that the server still send files to each client in parallel, for that us/N ≥ d_min, so us ≥ N·d_min, so each client can download the file in d_min, and the server can handle such bandwidth. In such way, we can have the distribution time F/d_min. 

c. When us/N <= dmin：

        N/us >= 1/d_min
        
        NF/us >= F/d_min
        
        So t = NF/us = max{NF/us, F/d_min}
        
When us/N >= d_min：

        N/us <= 1/d_min
        
        NF/us <= F/d_min
        
        So t = F/d_min = max{NF/us, F/d_min}

In conclusion, the minimum distribution time is max{NF/us，F/dmin}.

**P24.**

a. For that us ≤ (us+u1+u2+...+uN)/N, we have F/us ≥ NF/(us+u1+...+uN). For the ith peer client, the server can transfer a file block with size of uiF/(u1+u2+...+uN) to it with speed uius/(u1+u2+...+uN). Once a peer client receive its packet, it will distribute its packet to other peer clients immediately. So the server upload time is F/us, and the distribution time among the peer clients is (N-1)F/(u1+u2+...+uN), which means the server upload time is the bottleneck. For that the server upload and peer client distribution execute in parallel, the distribution time can be limited to F/us. 

b. Suppose that u1+u2+...+uN = u.

For that the distribution time is the NF/(us+u), we can say that the bottleneck is in the peer network, and the upload bandwidth of each peer client should be fully used. So we can find that the download speed of the ith peer client from other N-1 peer clients should be (u-ui)/(N-1). Besides, for that the total download speed of the ith peer client should be (us+u)/N, from the total distribution time NF/(us+u), so the upload speed from server to the ith peer client should be (us+u)/N-(u-ui)/(N-1) = us/N + ui/(N-1) - u/N(N-1). We can find that:

![formula1](https://github.com/antman9914/CitiChatbot/blob/master/hw4formula1.png?raw=true)

The sum exactly equals the server upload bandwidth. In such situation, the file size server upload will be NusF/(us+u) > F during the calculated time, there're some replicated parts, so we can design the distribution process like following:

Divide F into N+1 packets, the ith packet in the first N packets is with the size of uiNF/(N-1)(us+u), which will be uploaded to the ith peer client with speed ui/(N-1). The N+1 packet is of size F-NusF/(us+u), with the speed of us/N-u/N(N-1). Then the peer network bottleneck can be reached. 

c. To reach the minimum distribution time, the server must upload at least one copy of the entire file, and all the peer clients should download files with at least NF size.

When us ≥ (us+u1+...+uN)/N, the distribution time should be NF/(us+u1+...+uN)

When us < (us+u1+...+uN)/N, the distribution time should be F/us. 

In conclusion, the minimum distribution time should be max{F/us, NF/(us+u1+...+uN)}
