### P13

In SMTP, "MAIL FROM:" is to tell the server the source address of the email, which means it's a part of the SMTP protocol. 

On the other hand, "From:" is a part of the message content. 

### P21

We can use "dig server" command, and replace the "server" with the host which we want to test. If the query time is short enough, we can know that request message has been sent to the host seconds ago. 

### P25

Possible. The client can run on each host, so that each host can finish its own "free-riding" and combine data from different hosts into a file.
