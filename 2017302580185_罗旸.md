**Q21**

Yes, we can use dig to query that Web site in the local DNS server. If the Web site was just accessed a couple of seconds ago, an entry for it is cached in the local DNS cache, so the query time is 0 msec. Otherwise, the query time is large.

**Q23**

a) Let the server send the file to each client, in parallel, at a rate of u**s**/*N*. Note that this rate is less than each of the client’s download rate, since by assumption u**s**/*N* ≤ *d***min**. Thus each client can also receive at rate u**s**/*N*. Since each client receives at rate u**s**/*N*, the time for each client to receive the entire file is F/( u**s**/*N*) = *NF/ u**s**.* Since all the clients receive the file in *NF/ u***s**, the overall distribution time is also *NF/ u**s**.*

b) Let the server send the file to each client, in parallel, at a rate of *d***min**. Note that the aggregate rate, *N d***min**, is less than the server’s link rate *u***s**, since by assumption *u***s**/*N* ≥ *d***min**. Since each client receives at rate *d*min, the time for each client to receive the entire file is F/ *d***min**. Since all the clients receive the file in this time, the overall distribution time is also F/ *d***min**.

c) Firstly, we have
$$
D_{cs}\geq max(NF/u_{s},F/d_{min})
$$
Suppose that  
$$
u_{s}/N \le d_{min}
$$
Then we have
$$
D_{cs}\ge NF/u_{s}
$$
But from (a) we have 
$$
D_{cs}\le NF/u_{s}
$$
Combine these two:
$$
D_{cs} = NF/u_{s}, when \ u_{s}/N \le d_{min}
$$
Similarly, we can have 
$$
D_{cs} = F/d_{min}, when \ u_{s}/N \ge d_{min}
$$
Thus, the desored result has been gotten.

**Q24**

a) Define 
$$
u = u_{1}+u_{2}+...+u_{N}. By \ assumption \  u_{s}\le(u_{s}+u)/N
$$
Divide the file into N parts, and the **i** th part has size (u**i**/u)F. The server transmits the **i** th part to peer **i** at rate *r***i** =(*u***i**/*u*)*u***s**. Note that *r*1 + *r*2 +.....+*r*N =*u***s**, so that the aggregate server rate does not exceed the link rate of the server. Also have each peer **i** forward the bits it receives to each of the *N-1* peers at rate *r***i**. The aggregate forwarding rate by peer **i** is (N-1)r**i**. We have
$$
(N-1)r_{i}=(N-1)(u_{s}u_{i})/u \le u_{i}
$$
 Thus the aggregate forwarding rate of peer **i** is less than its link rate u**i**.

Thus each peer receives the file in F/u**s**.

b) Similarly, we have
$$
u_{s}\ge(u_{s}+u)/N \\ Let \ r_{i}=u_{i}/(N-1) \ and \\ r_{N+1}=(u_{s}-u/(N-1))/N
$$
Divide the file into N+1 parts. The server sends bits from the **i**th part to the ith peer (i = *1, ...., N*) at rate r**i**. Each peer **i** forwards the bits arriving at rate r**i** to each of the other N-1 peers. Additionally, the server sends bits from the *N+1*  part at rate r**N+1** to each of the *N* peers. The peers do not forward the bits from the *N+1* part.

Then, the aggregate send rate of the server is
$$
r_{1}+...+r_{N}+N\ r_{N+1} = u/(N-1)+u_{s}-u/(N-1) = u_{s}
$$
Thus, the server’s send rate does not exceed its link rate. Besides, the aggregate send rate of peer i is
$$
(N-1)r_{i}=u_{i}
$$
Which means each peer’s send rate does not exceed its link rate.

peer i receives bits at an aggregate rate of
$$
r_{i} +r_{N+1}+\sum_{j<>i}r_{j}=(u_{s}+u)/N
$$
So each peer receives the file in NF/(u**s**+u). 

c) We have
$$
D_{P2P}\ge max(F/u_{s},NF/(u_{s}+u))
$$
Combine this with a) and b) gives the desired result.
