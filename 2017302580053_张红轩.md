This problem involves many repetitive calculation, so I solve it by using a script:

```matlab
function [ time ] = D_cs(F,N, u_s, d)
%D_cs 计算在CS架构下传输时间
time = max([N*F/u_s,F/d]);
end

```

```matlab
function [ time ] = D_p2p(F,N, u_s, d, u)
%D_cs 计算在p2p架构下传输时间
time = max([F/u_s,F/d, N*F/(u_s+N*u)]);
end

```

```matlab
F = 15 * 10^9;
u_s = 30*10^6;
d_i = 2*10^6;
N = [10,100,1000];
u = [300000,700000,2*10^6];
% C-S 
cs = [];
for index = 1:3
    time = D_cs(F,N(index), u_s, d_i);
    cs = [cs;N(index),time];
end
% P2P
p2p = [];
for index = 1:3
    for index2 = 1:3
        time = D_p2p(F,N(index), u_s, d_i, u(index2));
        p2p = [p2p;N(index),u(index2),time];
    end
end

p2p_1 = p2p([1,4,7],:);
p2p_2 = p2p([2,5,8],:);
p2p_3 = p2p([3,6,9],:);
plot(p2p_1(:,1),p2p_1(:,3));
hold on;
plot(p2p_2(:,1),p2p_2(:,3));
plot(p2p_3(:,1),p2p_3(:,3));
plot(cs(:,1),cs(:,2));
```

 the picture result is:

(a) when u<sub>s</sub> / N <= d<sub>min</sub>

which means the bottleneck is the upload rate of the server is not enough, a distribution scheme that has a distribution time of NF/ u<sub>s</sub> should be the server provide the upload rate for each peer equally, which is u<sub>s</sub> / N

(b) when u<sub>s</sub> / N >= d<sub>min</sub>

the time would be decided by the peer which has the slowest rate, the distribution scheme is the server provide enough upload rate for the slowest peer.

(c) from (a) and (b), when the distribution scheme is not the situation I mention before, it would takes longer to to distribute. So the conclusion is max {NF/ u<sub>s</sub>,  F/d<sub>min</sub>}

(a) It is possible.  If the number of peers is  big enough, he can be optimistically thinks  that he can get every chunk. 

(b) It is possible. It can run the client on each host, make each host finishes its own "free-riding", and combine the collected chunks from different hosts into a file.
